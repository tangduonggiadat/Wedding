            The bride and groom continued to talk and</br>
            laugh as they walked through the park,getting</br>
            to know each other better. They discovered that</br>
            they had many shared interests and values, and</br>
            their conversation flowed effortlessly. It was </br>
            as if they had known each other for years.As they</br>
            walked, the groom couldn't help but feel that this </br>
            was meant to be. He had never felt such a trong </br>
            connection with anyone before, and he knew that he</br>
            had to see the bride again. Before they parted ways, </br>
            he asked for her phone number, and she happily gave</br>
            it to him. Over the next few weeks, the groom and </br>
            bride talked on the phone every day and went on </br>
            several dates.</br>
            They quickly fell in love and knew that they wanted</br>
            to spend the rest of their lives together.
