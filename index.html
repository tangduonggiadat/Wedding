            The bride and groom continued to talk and
            laugh as they walked through the park,getting
            to know each other better. They discovered that
            they had many shared interests and values, and
            their conversation flowed effortlessly. It was
            as if they had known each other for years.As they
            walked, the groom couldn't help but feel that this
            was meant to be. He had never felt such a trong
            connection with anyone before, and he knew that he
            had to see the bride again. Before they parted ways,
            he asked for her phone number, and she happily gave
            it to him. Over the next few weeks, the groom and
            bride talked on the phone every day and went on
            several dates.
            They quickly fell in love and knew that they wanted
            to spend the rest of their lives together.
